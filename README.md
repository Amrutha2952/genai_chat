GenAI Chat ðŸ¤–

GenAI Chat is a full-stack AI chat application that demonstrates real-world AI integration in a web app. Users can interact with an advanced AI assistant powered by LLaMA 3 (1B parameters) via Ollama, with multi-session support and device-specific conversation storage.

This project highlights AI model usage, API integration, real-time chat functionality, and full-stack development.

Key Features:
AI-powered Responses: Uses LLaMA 3 via Ollama to generate human-like responses.
FastAPI Backend: Lightweight, asynchronous, and production-ready API server.
Robust Error Handling: Returns safe fallback responses when the AI fails.
CORS Enabled: Allows frontend to communicate securely with the backend during development.
Logging: Tracks errors for debugging and monitoring.

Frontend / UX:
Multi-session chat management.
Typing animations for AI responses.
Copy AI replies to clipboard.
Theme customization and responsive design.
Session-specific message storage on the device.

Backend / AI:
Backend: Python, FastAPI, Ollama AI (LLaMA 3 model)
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Vite
Storage: Browser LocalStorage (per device/session)
